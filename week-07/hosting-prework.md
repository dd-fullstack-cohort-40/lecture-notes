# PWP Hosting Setup Prework
You will need to do some preliminary preparation before we start the PWP class lecture series.  Be sure to do this at least 24 hours in advance of the PWP Hosting Seupt lecture, as you may need to contact Digital Ocean support to iron out account verification issues.

## Gift Cards
- We use gift cards to give you $ for hosting and domain name set up.

### Make sure you set an address when activating your card
- Gift cards are often used by scammers because they are harder to trace.  This means that Digital Ocean, Paypal, etc. are pickier about accepting them
- Because past participants have had difficulties with verification, we suggest that you use a different personal form of payment.
## What you need to do
### 1. Activate your gift card and optionally link it to Paypal
- Authenticate card using the URL on the letter OR phone verification
    - Add your address on the card.  This will help when you are asked to verify the card, and is required if you choose to link your card.
    - We suggest doing this at home, as a whole lot of verifications coming from the same IP address or location can be flagged by credit card companies as suspicious.
- Go to PayPal and add the gift card as a method of payment

### 2. Buy a domain
- Any place you can buy a domain is fine, but our suggested domain registrar is Namecheap
    - Simple
    - Inexpensive
    - Digital Ocean has good doc for it
- You may use a domain you have already purchased if you wish
