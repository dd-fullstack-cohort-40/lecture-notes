# Project Management and Agile

## Project Management
- **project management (PM)** - the process by which we manage the day-to-day operations necessary to build websites
- Why study PM in a tech course?
    - Nearly every tech shop uses project management
    - Almost impossible to track teams of 3+ developers
- Basic concept: Time = money
    - devs are expensive to pay!
    - Minimize time spend managing tasks -> maximize time spent developing
    - PM tools help us
        - find what we should work on next
        - see how much work is left to do
        - divide work equitably
- In the beginning, there was **waterfalls**
    - Step 1: Gather specifications and establish timeline for the project
    - Step 2: Develop the project
    - Step 3: Test the project
    - Step 4: Launch the project
    - Step 5: Maintain the project
- Waterfalls was named because the project always went to the next step and never backward, like
  water in a series of waterfalls
- Diagram and more info: https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/waterfall-project-management-methodology
- Came out of manufacturing and construction
- Good stuff:
    - Promises certainty for budget and timeline
    - One big push for development, then little further thought
    - Waterfalls is good for projects that
        - Are easily predictable
        - Have a well-defined and well-understood solution
        - Contain irreversible steps
- Problems for software development
    - development frequently reveals unanticipated difficulties
        - going back to Step 1 breaks the process!
    - many projects are continuous, and so never hit the maintenance phase
    - stakeholders see what is built only at the end of the process
        - sometimes forget what they asked for, or realize that what was delivered doesn't meet their needs
    - hard to test and launch, because there's tons of new functionality and the real-world implications are not yet understood

## Agile
In 2001, in response to the waterfalls-dominated version of software development, a few people in software development got together and published the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
- **agile** - a method of software development that stresses:
    - frequent collaboration between developers, management, and project stakeholders
    - an iterative process - build a **minimum viable product** (MVP) early in the process and make continuous improvements on it
    - **sprints** - one- or two-week periods used for planning development work
    - **ticket** - A task that a developer is assigned to work on.
        - Usually, a developer works on one ticket at a time until it is ready for testing.
        - Each sprint has multiple tickets
    - flexibility - requirements and deliverables can change mid-development
    - frequent, small launches of new functionality
    - an emphasis on quality
        - Cheap, good, fast, pick two
- Agile dovetails perfectly with the internet as a distribution model â€“ easier to communicate and launch frequently
- Caveat: "agile" is very, very diluted as a term, and has come to represent many different methods of development - Kanban, Scrum, Lean software development, extreme programming and more
    - Two methods that both call themselves "agile" can be very different in practice.
- We mix-and-match methods here, as do most development shops
    - Stand-up meetings: 15 minute meetings at 8:00 MWF
        - What you did (including tech work/events outside of class)
        - What you're going to do next
    - Sprint-based workflow with tickets on PM software
    - frequent communication between stakeholders (instructors) and developers (students)
